3-3-2015 3hrs - started converting tutorial and got words saving into a collection
3-4-2015 8hrs - organized the files into reasonable directory structure; set up iron-router and set up the main app routes;
  built a rough draft with a little CSS of the build page that had the form elements and could add words to a collection but still wasn't ready to add to the entry collection
3-5-2015 8hrs - added home, view, build and admin links into main.html; fixed error when accessing view page without a /id; finished off the
  build page's basic functionality, and got a dirty list of entries and single entry viewing on view page;added a feature to the admin page
  to import some text files I created from copying and pasting the output of the old google app engine version of this game, so we can now
  easily get all the old words into the game by pasting them into the box on the admin page
3-6-2015 - 7hrs - changed dates to use date object instead of timestamp, as recommended by mongodb docs; got rid of clear word collection button
  in admin page; made build page word list do an infinite horizontal scroll within its container; changed the getting of the word cards to getting
  a single randomized card with each button click; added working discard button to each card; cleaned up the view a little bit (the view view if you will)
  and split the stylesheet out into view.css and build.css
